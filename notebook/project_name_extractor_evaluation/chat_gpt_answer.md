Evaluating a function that extracts project names from customer emails requires both **quantitative metrics** and a **systematic approach** to assess its accuracy and performance. Since there is a **ground truth CSV file** containing both the expected project names and the customer email content, we can measure how well the function performs by comparing its outputs with the expected results.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Define the Evaluation Metrics**:
   The most appropriate metrics for this task are:

   - **Accuracy**: Measures how often the function correctly extracts the project name. It's the ratio of correctly identified project names to the total number of cases.
   - **Precision**: Measures the percentage of correctly extracted project names among all names extracted by the function.
   - **Recall**: Measures how many of the actual project names were correctly extracted by the function.
   - **F1 Score**: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful when you want a balance between precision and recall.

2. **Approach**:
   - **Extract**: Run the function over the email subjects or bodies to extract the project names.
   - **Compare**: Compare the extracted project names with the ground truth provided in the CSV file.
   - **Evaluate**: Calculate the evaluation metrics based on the comparison results.

### Example in Python Using Pandas

Here’s how you can implement the evaluation process using Python, with a focus on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This example assumes that you have a function `extract_project_name` that extracts the project name from the subject or body of the email.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Sample CSV Data
data = {
    'source_system': ['evdi', 'evdi'],
    'expected_project_id': ['{54EE27F7-BFB3-49BD-9438-2BE412C8D8A0}', '{54EE27F7-BFB3-49BD-9438-2BE412C8D8A0}'],
    'expected_project_name': ['DFI Zukunftspark Oberfranken VI', 'DFI Zukunftspark Oberfranken VI'],
    'subject': [
        'Welche Sicherheiten bietet das Projekt DFI Zukunftspark Oberfranken VI?',
        'Wie ist die Verzinsung für Investoren im Projekt DFI Zukunftspark Oberfranken VI?'
    ],
    'body': [
        'Können Sie mir bitte mitteilen, welche Sicherheiten im angeboten werden? Es ist mir wichtig zu wissen, wie mein Investment abgesichert wird und ob es zusätzliche Garantien gibt.',
        'Ich interessiere mich für die Verzinsung beim Projekt DFI Zukunftspark Oberfranken VI. Wann beginnt diese und wie hoch ist sie? Gibt es Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen Investitionssummen?'
    ]
}

# Load the data into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Placeholder function for extracting project name (to be replaced with your actual function)
def extract_project_name(subject, body):
    # Here you will implement your actual logic
    # For simplicity, we assume it finds the project name in the subject.
    # In a real-world case, you would need a more complex pattern matching or NLP extraction method.
    if 'DFI Zukunftspark Oberfranken VI' in subject:
        return 'DFI Zukunftspark Oberfranken VI'
    return None

# Apply the function to extract project names from the emails
df['extracted_project_name'] = df.apply(lambda row: extract_project_name(row['subject'], row['body']), axis=1)

# Ground truth and predictions
y_true = df['expected_project_name']
y_pred = df['extracted_project_name']

# Compute metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='micro')  # Since it's a multiclass problem, we can use 'micro'
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='micro')
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='micro')

# Print results
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(f"Precision: {precision}")
print(f"Recall: {recall}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1}")
```

### Explanation of Key Parts:

1. **`extract_project_name` Function**:
   This function is a placeholder in the example. You'll need to replace it with the actual logic that extracts project names from the email's subject or body. You might use pattern matching (like regex) or more advanced NLP techniques (such as named entity recognition).

2. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: This tells you how often the function correctly extracts the project name.
   - **Precision**: This is the percentage of correct project names among the extracted names.
   - **Recall**: This measures how many of the ground truth names the function was able to find.
   - **F1 Score**: This gives a balance between precision and recall, important if you care about both false positives and false negatives.

### Next Steps:

- If your function returns **partial names** or names that are similar but not exact (e.g., `DFI Zukunftspark Oberfranken` instead of `DFI Zukunftspark Oberfranken VI`), you might need to consider using **string similarity metrics** like Levenshtein distance.
- If your model is dealing with multiple project names and variants, then you can implement a **ranking evaluation** (like Mean Reciprocal Rank or Mean Average Precision) to assess the quality of retrieval when multiple projects are mentioned.

This approach will give you a comprehensive evaluation of how well your project name extraction function is working!
