i#  Question 1
I am building a knowledge base that will have the following metadata:
1. section (For instance, AGB question, General Project question, Information for customers)
2. Question. Has a question, that customers can ask
3. Answer. An answer to the question. 

For instance:
General Project Questions;How high is the fixed interest rate for investors in the 'The Five' project and when does it start? What is the minimum term for the interest rate, even in the event of early repayment by the borrower?;The fixed interest rate is 5.6% p.a. and starts immediately upon receipt of the money. The minimum term is approximately 25 months until May 27, 2024, with at least 22 months of interest guaranteed even in the event of early repayment by February 27, 2024.

my task is to create CSV file for 100 projects to index them. I cannot understand how I can reference to projects in index? How can retrieval system distinguish all of them?

For instance, if a customer asks "What is the interest rate for the Project X", how can the retrieval system fetch information that is related exactly to the Project X, not for the Project Y? 
Which fields should I add to the index and how can I fetch data?

#  Answer 1
To create an efficient retrieval system for your knowledge base where questions are indexed by specific projects, you need to ensure that each entry in your database has enough metadata to distinguish between projects. Here's how you can approach it:

### 1. **Add Project Metadata**
   You should add a field to represent each project specifically. This could be a unique identifier for each project or a project name. This will allow the retrieval system to differentiate between questions related to "Project X" and those related to "Project Y". Here's what your additional metadata could look like:
   
   - **Project Name (or ID)**: A unique field to represent each project (e.g., "Project X" or a unique project identifier). This is essential for distinguishing between multiple projects.
   - **Project Category/Type (Optional)**: If projects fall into categories or types, you can add this as an optional metadata field (e.g., "Residential", "Commercial", etc.).

### 2. **Example CSV Format with Added Fields**
   Here’s an example of how your CSV format could be structured:

   ```csv
   Project Name;Project ID;Section;Question;Answer
   The Five;101;General Project Questions;How high is the fixed interest rate for investors in the 'The Five' project and when does it start? What is the minimum term for the interest rate, even in the event of early repayment by the borrower?;The fixed interest rate is 5.6% p.a. and starts immediately upon receipt of the money. The minimum term is approximately 25 months until May 27, 2024, with at least 22 months of interest guaranteed even in the event of early repayment by February 27, 2024.
   Skyline Tower;102;AGB Questions;What happens if the borrower misses payments for the Skyline Tower project?;If the borrower misses a payment, the investment contract stipulates certain penalties, which vary depending on the duration of the delay and the project terms.
   ```
   
   In this CSV format:
   - **Project Name**: The name of the project (e.g., "The Five", "Skyline Tower").
   - **Project ID**: A unique identifier for each project (e.g., 101, 102). This can be helpful for internal referencing.
   - **Section**: The section/category of the knowledge base question (e.g., "AGB Questions", "General Project Questions").
   - **Question**: The actual question related to the project.
   - **Answer**: The response to the question.

### 3. **Fields to Add to the Index**
   The index should have the following fields to make sure the retrieval system can easily distinguish between projects:
   
   - **Project Name or Project ID**: This will be the primary reference to retrieve project-specific data. If the user’s query mentions "Project X", the system can directly retrieve all knowledge base entries with that project name or ID.
   - **Section**: This helps categorize the type of question, which may also help refine retrieval (e.g., "General Questions", "Financial Information", etc.).
   - **Question**: The question itself will be indexed for text-based retrieval.
   - **Answer**: The answer to the question will be retrieved and displayed based on the query.

### 4. **How Retrieval Can Work**
   When a user asks a question like "What is the interest rate for Project X?":
   - **Keyword Matching**: The system can extract keywords such as "interest rate" and "Project X".
   - **Project-Specific Filtering**: The system should first filter by the **Project Name/ID** (e.g., "Project X") to ensure only data related to that project is considered.
   - **Section and Question Matching**: Within the filtered project-specific data, it can further refine the results by looking for keywords related to the question (e.g., "interest rate").

### 5. **Fetch Data by Using a Full-Text Search Engine**
   - **Search by Project ID or Name**: When indexing the data, ensure that the **Project Name** or **Project ID** is part of the query used for the search.
   - **Full-Text Search for Questions**: Use a full-text search engine (like Elasticsearch, MeiliSearch, or even PostgreSQL with the `tsvector` type) that allows you to search within the question/answer content as well.
   - **Rank the Results**: Rank the results based on relevance to the user query (for example, based on how well the project and question match the keywords in the query).
   
### 6. **Further Improvements**
   - **Synonyms or Tags**: Consider adding a "tags" or "keywords" column to capture synonymous terms or relevant keywords that might differ from project to project but still relate to the same topic.
   - **Fallback Mechanism**: If a project-specific question isn’t found, the retrieval system can fall back on more general answers (i.e., project-agnostic data).

### Final CSV Format (with Recommended Fields):
   ```csv
   Project Name;Project ID;Section;Question;Answer;Tags;Created_At
   The Five;101;General Project Questions;How high is the fixed interest rate for investors in the 'The Five' project and when does it start?;The fixed interest rate is 5.6% p.a. and starts immediately upon receipt of the money.;interest rate, fixed rate, start date;2023-09-21
   Skyline Tower;102;Financial Questions;What happens if the borrower misses payments for the Skyline Tower project?;If the borrower misses a payment, the contract stipulates certain penalties, which vary depending on the duration of the delay.;missed payment, penalties, late payment;2023-09-21
   ```

This approach will help ensure the retrieval system can distinguish and retrieve the correct project-specific data based on the user’s query.

#  Question 2
Based on your data, suggest the index for the ElasticSearch.

#  Answer 2
For indexing data in Elasticsearch for a knowledge base that contains information about different projects, the index needs to be structured to support efficient retrieval of project-specific questions and answers. Given the data structure you outlined, the Elasticsearch index can be optimized by ensuring that certain fields are both **filterable** (like `Project Name` or `Project ID`) and **searchable** (like `Question` and `Answer`).

Here’s how you can define the index mapping for your Elasticsearch index:

### 1. **Index Mapping**
The index mapping is a schema that defines how the fields in your documents should be indexed and searched. The following is a recommended mapping for your knowledge base:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "project_name": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "project_id": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "section": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "question": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "standard"
      },
      "answer": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "standard"
      },
      "tags": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "created_at": {
        "type": "date"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Explanation of Fields in the Mapping**

- **`project_name` (`keyword`)**: The name of the project. It is indexed as a `keyword` field, meaning it will be used for **exact matching**. This is essential for filtering answers related to a specific project.
  
- **`project_id` (`keyword`)**: A unique identifier for the project. Like `project_name`, this is also a `keyword` and is used for exact matching. For internal use, this might be a more reliable identifier.
  
- **`section` (`keyword`)**: The section of the knowledge base (e.g., "AGB Questions", "General Project Questions"). This is treated as a keyword, since sections are typically predefined categories that can be filtered.
  
- **`question` (`text`)**: This is indexed as a `text` field with the standard analyzer, which means it will be **tokenized** for full-text search. It allows users to perform searches based on the content of the question (e.g., "interest rate for Project X").
  
- **`answer` (`text`)**: Like the `question` field, this is also indexed as a `text` field with full-text search capabilities, which allows the retrieval of relevant answers based on user queries.
  
- **`tags` (`keyword`)**: Tags or keywords that are related to the question/answer pair. These can help further narrow down the search and provide more context (e.g., "interest rate", "missed payment"). These are indexed as exact match keywords.
  
- **`created_at` (`date`)**: A date field to track when the record was added. This is helpful for filtering or sorting based on recency (e.g., showing the most recent answers first).

### 3. **Sample Document for Elasticsearch**
Here’s an example of a document in Elasticsearch that matches your data structure:

```json
{
  "project_name": "The Five",
  "project_id": "101",
  "section": "General Project Questions",
  "question": "How high is the fixed interest rate for investors in the 'The Five' project and when does it start? What is the minimum term for the interest rate, even in the event of early repayment by the borrower?",
  "answer": "The fixed interest rate is 5.6% p.a. and starts immediately upon receipt of the money. The minimum term is approximately 25 months until May 27, 2024, with at least 22 months of interest guaranteed even in the event of early repayment by February 27, 2024.",
  "tags": ["interest rate", "fixed rate", "start date"],
  "created_at": "2023-09-21T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### 4. **Search Scenarios**
Here’s how Elasticsearch would handle different types of queries based on the index:

#### A. **Project-Specific Query (Exact Match)**
If the user asks "What is the interest rate for Project X?":
- You can **filter** by `project_name` or `project_id` to ensure that only documents related to "Project X" are considered.
- Then, use a **full-text search** on the `question` field for terms like "interest rate".

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": [
        { "term": { "project_name": "The Five" } }
      ],
      "must": [
        { "match": { "question": "interest rate" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### B. **General Search Without Project Filtering**
If the user asks a more general question like "What is the interest rate for projects?":
- You can perform a **full-text search** across the `question` and `answer` fields, without applying any project filters. This will return results from multiple projects.

```json
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "interest rate",
      "fields": ["question", "answer"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### C. **Filter by Section**
If the user asks for questions from a specific section, like "AGB Questions":
- You can filter based on the `section` field to retrieve questions from the relevant category.

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": [
        { "term": { "section": "AGB Questions" } }
      ],
      "must": [
        { "match": { "question": "borrower" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. **Additional Optimizations**
- **Synonyms**: You can configure a synonym analyzer in Elasticsearch to handle different terminology for similar concepts (e.g., "rate", "interest rate", "yield").
- **Boosting**: You can apply boosting to certain fields to give more weight to the `project_name` or `question` fields when they match the user query.
- **Autocomplete**: Implementing an autocomplete feature based on the `question` field can help improve the user experience by suggesting questions as the user types their query.

### 6. **Conclusion**
To build a robust retrieval system in Elasticsearch:
- Use **`project_name` or `project_id`** for exact matching when filtering by project.
- Use **`question` and `answer`** fields as **text** for full-text search capabilities.
- Add **`tags`** and **`section`** to further enhance search filtering and categorization.

This structure ensures that your system can efficiently differentiate between projects and return highly relevant results for the user’s query.


#  Question 3
I am planning to use Hugging Face library. Can you propose how can I extract project_name from the users' questions in order to use them as keywords? Should I have a list of all projects, etc? What should be my actions? Please note, that the questions will be in German, I cannot use models that were designed for English.

#  Answer 3
To extract the `project_name` from user questions in German using the Hugging Face library, there are several strategies you can follow. Since you plan to use Hugging Face, you'll have access to multilingual models that support German, as well as specialized German models.

Here’s how you can approach this:

### 1. **Maintain a List of Project Names**
Yes, maintaining a list of all project names is a crucial step. This list can serve as a reference for identifying project names within user queries. The project names can be stored in a database or a file, and you can update this list as new projects are introduced.

For example:
```json
[
  "Projekt A",
  "Projekt B",
  "Das Haus",
  "The Five"
]
```

You will need to use these project names as keywords to identify which project the user is asking about in their query. Here's the step-by-step plan:

### 2. **Using a German Model for Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

https://huggingface.co/models?language=de&other=named-entity-recognition&sort=modified

Hugging Face provides several pre-trained models that are specifically designed for the German language and include Named Entity Recognition (NER) functionality. You can use these models to extract project names from user questions. Although project names may not always fall under traditional entity categories (like `ORG`, `LOC`, etc.), you can use NER as a first step to extract potential entity candidates.

For example, use the `deepset/gbert-large` or `dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english` models, which support German:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the German NER model from Hugging Face
ner = pipeline("ner", model="dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-german")

# Example question
question = "Was ist der Zinssatz für das Projekt The Five?"

# Apply NER to extract named entities
entities = ner(question)

for entity in entities:
    print(entity)
```

The NER model may identify project names if they resemble named entities (such as organizations). However, NER might not always be perfect for this specific task, so you will likely need additional steps.

### 3. **Fuzzy Matching for Project Name Recognition**
Since project names may not always be recognized by NER, another effective method is **fuzzy string matching**. Once you have a list of project names, you can use libraries like `fuzzywuzzy` or Hugging Face's `datasets` library to perform fuzzy matching between the user’s question and your list of project names.

Here’s how you can implement fuzzy matching:

```python
from fuzzywuzzy import process

# List of project names
projects = ["Projekt A", "Projekt B", "Das Haus", "The Five"]

# User's question
question = "Was ist der Zinssatz für das Projekt The Five?"

# Extract the most likely project from the question using fuzzy matching
project_name, confidence = process.extractOne(question, projects)

print(f"Matched Project: {project_name} with confidence: {confidence}")
```

In this case, you’d extract the project name `"The Five"` from the question and then proceed to query your index based on that result.

### 4. **Keyword-Based Approach**
A simpler approach is to scan the user’s question for keywords that match project names from your list. This approach works well when you have well-defined project names.

Here’s an example:

```python
# List of project names
projects = ["Projekt A", "Projekt B", "Das Haus", "The Five"]

# User's question
question = "Was ist der Zinssatz für das Projekt The Five?"

# Look for exact matches of project names in the question
matched_projects = [project for project in projects if project.lower() in question.lower()]

if matched_projects:
    print(f"Project found: {matched_projects[0]}")
else:
    print("No project found.")
```

This method is faster and simpler but may miss typos or partial matches, which is why combining it with fuzzy matching can be very effective.

### 5. **Train a Custom Model for Project Name Extraction**
If you have sufficient data, you can fine-tune a German transformer model (e.g., BERT, XLM-R, or GPT) to extract project names specifically. You’ll need labeled training data that highlights project names in various sentences. Hugging Face makes it easy to fine-tune models for NER or other tasks using the `Trainer` API.

The workflow would look like this:
1. Label the training data (questions with highlighted project names).
2. Fine-tune a pre-trained German model like `bert-base-german-cased` or `xlm-roberta-large`.
3. Use the fine-tuned model to extract project names.

### 6. **Actionable Steps**

1. **Prepare a List of Project Names**: Create and maintain an up-to-date list of all project names (or project IDs).
2. **Use a Pre-Trained German NER Model**: Try out pre-trained German NER models from Hugging Face and see if they can identify project names from user questions.
3. **Incorporate Fuzzy Matching**: Use fuzzy matching techniques to capture project names, especially when there might be slight variations in spelling or wording in the user query.
4. **Combine Methods**: Combine NER and fuzzy matching approaches for optimal performance. NER will help with more structured entities, while fuzzy matching will catch variations.
5. **Use Hugging Face Pipelines**: Implement the retrieval logic using Hugging Face’s `pipeline` functions for NER and text search.
6. **Future Option – Train a Custom Model**: Fine-tune a custom model for project name extraction if your project grows and you want more precise control over entity recognition.

### 7. **Example Workflow with Fuzzy Matching + NER**
Here’s an example that combines NER and fuzzy matching:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from fuzzywuzzy import process

# Load NER model
ner = pipeline("ner", model="dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-german")

# List of project names
projects = ["Projekt A", "Projekt B", "Das Haus", "The Five"]

# User's question
question = "Was ist der Zinssatz für das Projekt The Five?"

# Step 1: Try to identify named entities
entities = ner(question)

# Step 2: Fuzzy matching for project names
project_name, confidence = process.extractOne(question, projects)

# Combine results
print(f"Entities found: {entities}")
print(f"Fuzzy Matched Project: {project_name} with confidence: {confidence}")
```

By applying both approaches, you increase the chances of accurately extracting the project name from the user's question.

### Conclusion
1. **Maintain a list of all project names** as a reference.
2. Use **NER models** from Hugging Face, preferably multilingual or German-specific models.
3. Employ **fuzzy matching** to enhance project name extraction from questions.
4. Consider fine-tuning a custom model for German question-answer data if you require greater accuracy.

This hybrid approach ensures your system is capable of accurately extracting project names and directing user queries to the correct information.
